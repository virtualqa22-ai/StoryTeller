# Hypotheses to Test

## Hypothesis 1: Story Bible is Primary Value Driver
**Test:** "Users will rank Story Bible consistency tracking as #1 or #2 most valuable feature"
**Method:** Ask users to rank features by value: Writing tools, Story Bible, AI generation, Professional export, Progress tracking
**Invalidation Trigger:** If < 60% rank it top 2, it's not primary value driver
**Action if Invalidated:** Reassess positioning and feature priorities

## Hypothesis 2: AI Trust Requires Transparency
**Test:** "Users who see validation proof will trust AI more than those who see simple success message"
**Method:** A/B test in prototype - show half Group A (simple "✓ Success"), half Group B (detailed proof)
**Invalidation Trigger:** If no significant trust difference between groups
**Action if Invalidated:** Simplify UX, remove transparency layers

## Hypothesis 3: Multiple Onboarding Paths Increase Completion
**Test:** "Users will prefer different paths based on learning style, and choice increases satisfaction"
**Method:** Track which path users choose and measure satisfaction
**Invalidation Trigger:** If > 80% choose same path, multiple paths are unnecessary complexity
**Action if Invalidated:** Build single best path, remove options

## Hypothesis 4: Sarah is Largest Market Segment
**Test:** "First-time/aspiring authors outnumber prolific pros 5:1 in willingness to pay"
**Method:** Recruitment difficulty + pricing research + TAM analysis
**Invalidation Trigger:** If James-types show higher willingness to pay or larger available market
**Action if Invalidated:** Shift primary persona to James, redesign for productivity-first

## Hypothesis 5: Users Will Pay $50-100
**Test:** "Target users have willingness to pay $50+ for Story Bible + AI features"
**Method:** Van Westendorp pricing sensitivity analysis
**Invalidation Trigger:** If optimal price point < $30, business model needs revision
**Action if Invalidated:** Pursue freemium model or reduce scope to lower development cost

## Hypothesis 6: Offline-First is Feature, Not Limitation
**Test:** "Users value offline capability and local storage for privacy/independence"
**Method:** Ask about cloud sync importance vs. offline work, privacy concerns
**Invalidation Trigger:** If > 70% demand multi-device sync as must-have
**Action if Invalidated:** Prioritize cloud sync in v1.0, not v1.5
