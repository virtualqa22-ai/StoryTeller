# Interview Methodology

## Interview Structure (60 minutes)

**Part 1: Current State Discovery (20 minutes)**

**Questions:**
1. Tell me about your novel writing process from start to finish.
2. Walk me through a typical writing session. What tools do you use?
3. What's the hardest part of writing a novel for you?
4. How do you track character details, plot points, world-building rules?
   - Prompts: Spreadsheets? Notes? Memory? Software?
5. Tell me about a time you forgot a story detail. What happened?
6. Have you tried AI writing tools? Which ones?
   - If yes: What was your experience? What did you love/hate?
   - If no: What's stopped you from trying them?
7. How do you ensure consistency across your manuscript?
   - How much time do you spend on this?
   - What tools or methods do you use?

**Part 2: Pain Point Validation (15 minutes)**

**Show examples of AI contradictions:**
- Example 1: Character's eye color changes (blue → brown)
- Example 2: Timeline inconsistency (Tuesday → Thursday)
- Example 3: Profession change (scientist → teacher)

**Questions:**
1. Has this ever happened to you? How often?
2. How did you discover it? How did you fix it?
3. If this happened in your published novel, how would you feel?
4. On a scale of 1-10, how much does this problem affect you?
   - 1 = Never happens, not a concern
   - 10 = Happens constantly, major frustration
5. What would "perfect consistency tracking" look like to you?
6. What would make you trust an AI tool with your story?

**Part 3: Concept Testing (20 minutes)**

**Test 1: Story Bible Mental Model**

Show Figma mockup of Story Bible concept (character cards, location entries, plot points).

**Questions:**
1. In your own words, what do you think this does?
2. Would this solve a problem you currently have?
3. What concerns do you have about using something like this?
4. How is this different from what you do now?
5. On a scale of 1-10, how valuable would this be to you?

**Test 2: Three-Layer Visibility**

Show three levels:
- Layer 1: Simple "✓ No contradictions detected"
- Layer 2: Progress indicators "Checking 15 character details, 8 plot points..."
- Layer 3: Full transparency "Marcus's blue eyes matches Chapter 3, Military background matches Chapter 1..."

**Questions:**
1. Which layer would you look at most often? Why?
2. Would you ever click "View Details" (Layer 3)? When?
3. Does seeing this level of detail make you trust the AI more or less? Why?
4. What information is missing that you'd want to see?

**Test 3: Onboarding Paths**

Show three options:
- Guided: 5-step wizard with explanations
- Quick Start: Minimal setup, start writing immediately
- Demo Project: Pre-populated example to explore

**Questions:**
1. Which would you choose? Why?
2. Have you ever abandoned software during setup? What happened?
3. What would make you complete the setup vs. abandon it?

**Part 4: Pricing & Value (5 minutes)**

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter:**

1. **Too Cheap:** "At what price would you feel this product is so inexpensive that you'd question its quality?"
2. **Bargain:** "At what price would you consider this product a bargain—a great buy for the money?"
3. **Expensive:** "At what price would you say this product is getting expensive, but you'd still consider buying it?"
4. **Too Expensive:** "At what price would this product be so expensive that you wouldn't consider buying it?"

**Additional Questions:**
1. Would you prefer to pay once ($X) or monthly ($Y)? Why?
2. If the base app was $89 (writing + manual Story Bible) and AI features were $99/year extra, would that make sense?
3. What features would you expect in a free version vs. paid?
4. How does this compare to [Scrivener $49 / Sudowrite $100/mo / Atticus $147]?

**Wrap-up:**
1. What's the one feature that would make you switch from your current tools?
2. Is there anything we didn't talk about that's important to you?
3. Would you be interested in trying an early version (beta) when available?
