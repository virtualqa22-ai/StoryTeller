## Primary Objectives

1. **Validate Persona Accuracy**

2. **Validate Pain Points**
   - Is AI consistency/contradiction a real problem users experience?
   - How much time/frustration does manual consistency checking cause?
   - Are there other pain points more severe than assumed?

3. **Validate Story Bible Value Proposition**
   - Do users understand the "Story Bible" concept?
   - Would transparent AI validation build trust?
   - Is this feature worth paying for?

4. **Validate Feature Priorities**
   - Which features matter most: Story Bible, AI generation, Export, Progress tracking?
   - What's "must-have" vs. "nice-to-have"?
   - Are we missing critical features?

5. **Validate Pricing Sensitivity**
   - What's acceptable price point: $50? $99? $149?
   - One-time purchase vs. subscription preference?
