# Action Planning

## **Priority #1: Context Management System**

**Why This Matters:** Foundation that enables everything else - the competitive moat

**Next Steps:**
1. Design rules data structure (CRITICAL vs. PREFERENCE types, storage format) - Week 1
2. Build pattern detection logic (detect repeated patterns, suggestion UI) - Weeks 2-3
3. Implement rule enforcement layer (pre-generation validation, conflict detection) - Weeks 3-4
4. Create hybrid confirmation flow (AI suggests → user confirms → rule added) - Week 4

**Resources:** Backend developer, AI/ML engineer, UX designer
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks MVP
**Success Indicators:** Rules persist, AI follows consistently, pattern detection 80%+ accurate

## **Priority #2: Perfect Export System**

**Why This Matters:** Immediate tangible value, saves 10-20 hours per book, eliminates $250 Vellum cost

**Next Steps:**
1. Research export standards (PDF dimensions, EPUB3 requirements, Amazon KDP specs) - Week 1
2. Build PDF generation engine (custom page size, margins, fonts, chapter styling) - Weeks 2-4
3. Build EPUB generation engine (metadata, TOC, validation, device preview) - Weeks 3-5
4. Create preset system (save/load configs, templates, one-click export) - Weeks 5-6

**Resources:** Backend developer (PDF/EPUB expertise), designer, e-readers for testing
**Timeline:** 5-6 weeks full implementation
**Success Indicators:** Print-ready PDFs, EPUB3 validated, < 30 sec export, custom presets work

## **Priority #3: Long-Form Accuracy**

**Why This Matters:** What makes StoryTeller's AI truly different - other tools fail at this scale

**Next Steps:**
1. Design validation architecture (define checks, pipeline structure) - Week 1
2. Implement chapter context assembly (previous chapters, profiles, threads, rules) - Weeks 2-3
3. Build novel-arc intelligence (story structure templates, position awareness) - Weeks 3-4
4. Create big chapter generator (4,000-8,000 words with structure) - Weeks 4-6

**Resources:** AI/ML engineer, backend developer, advanced AI models, test novels
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks MVP, ongoing refinement
**Success Indicators:** 4,000+ word chapters, zero contradictions, plot threads advanced, 80,000+ word novels without consistency breaks
