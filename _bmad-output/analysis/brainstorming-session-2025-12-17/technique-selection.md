# Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Comprehensive exploration of StoryTeller application with focus on generating diverse ideas, identifying problems and solutions, exploring innovative differentiation, and discovering unexpected opportunities

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Mind Mapping** (Structured Thinking) - Foundation setting and problem space exploration. Creates visual organization of all StoryTeller components (features, UX, AI, monetization, export) and reveals connections between domains. Expected outcome: Complete visual landscape of the application with emerging patterns.

2. **Cross-Pollination** (Creative Innovation) - Innovation and differentiation through transferring successful patterns from other industries (gaming, music production, graphic design, education). Expected outcome: Unique feature ideas that differentiate StoryTeller from competitors.

3. **Persona Journey** (Theatrical Exploration) - User-centric ideation by embodying different writer archetypes (aspiring novelist, experienced author, hobbyist, professional editor). Expected outcome: User-validated features grounded in real needs.

4. **What If Scenarios** (Creative Innovation) - Opportunity discovery by questioning all constraints and exploring radical possibilities. Expected outcome: Breakthrough ideas and moonshot features for future differentiation.

**AI Rationale:** This sequence balances structured organization (Mind Mapping) with creative breakthrough thinking (Cross-Pollination, What If), while grounding everything in real user needs (Persona Journey). The multi-phase approach matches the comprehensive, multi-domain nature of the session goals, moving from foundation through innovation to user validation and opportunity discovery.

**Total Session Time:** 70-95 minutes
