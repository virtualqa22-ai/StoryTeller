# Next Steps for Karan

**This Week:**
1. Review this session document and internalize the three core differentiators
2. Make tech stack decisions (frameworks, languages, AI models, database)
3. Start Context Management system design (data structure, rule types)
4. Research export libraries (PDF/EPUB generation options)

**Next BMM Workflow:**
You're ready to move from Discovery into Planning phase! Consider running:
- **/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-prd** - Transform these insights into comprehensive Product Requirements Document
- Load the **pm** agent first, then run the PRD workflow

Your brainstorming has provided excellent foundation for a detailed PRD that will guide implementation.
