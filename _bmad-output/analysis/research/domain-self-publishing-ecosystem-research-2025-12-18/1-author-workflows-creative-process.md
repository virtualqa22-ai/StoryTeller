# 1. Author Workflows & Creative Process

## 1.1 Pre-Writing Phase

**Planning Methodologies:**

Authors fall on a spectrum between **plotters** (outliners) and **pantsers** (discovery writers), with most using hybrid approaches ([The Creative Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2022/09/30/outlining-plotting-discovery-writing-pantsing/)).

**Popular Outlining Methods:** ([MasterClass](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/4-techniques-for-outlining-novels))

1. **Snowflake Method** (Randy Ingermanson)
   - Begins with one-sentence summary
   - Expands iteratively to paragraph, then page, then full outline
   - Popular with structured writers

2. **Bookend Method**
   - Plot start and end, leave middle flexible
   - Defines main characters but allows discovery
   - Preferred by hybrid plotters/pantsers

3. **Spreadsheet Method** (Russell Blake)
   - Chapter numbers down left, character names across top
   - Few sentences per cell detailing character involvement
   - Used by thriller/mystery writers for complex plotting

4. **Save the Cat! Beat Sheet** (Blake Snyder)
   - 15-beat story structure template
   - Adapted from screenwriting
   - Popular in commercial fiction

**Important Reality:** "Novel outlines will change before your last draft is done because your book is going to evolve as you write it" ([Reedsy Blog](https://blog.reedsy.com/how-to-outline-a-book/))

**Pre-Writing Techniques:** ([Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/services/writing-center/writing-resources/prewriting-and-outlining/))
- Brainstorming (freeform idea generation)
- Clustering (visual mind-mapping)
- Freewriting (stream of consciousness drafting)
- Character interviews and world-building documents

## 1.2 Drafting Phase

**Typical Drafting Workflow:**

1. **First Draft**: "Permission to write badly" - focus on completion
2. **Self-Editing Pass 1**: Major structural issues, plot holes, pacing
3. **Self-Editing Pass 2**: Scene-level revisions, character consistency
4. **Beta Readers**: External feedback from target audience
5. **Self-Editing Pass 3**: Address beta feedback
6. **Professional Editing**: Developmental, then copy/line editing
7. **Proofreading**: Final pass before formatting

**Reality Check:** "Novel outlines will change" applies equally to drafts - flexibility required ([Reedsy](https://blog.reedsy.com/how-to-outline-a-book/))

## 1.3 Current Tool Usage Patterns

**Writing Tools:** ([Rafal Reyzer](https://rafalreyzer.com/outlining-software-for-writers/))
- **Scrivener** (dominant): "Tremendous outlining software for both fiction and nonfiction writers"
- **Microsoft Word/Google Docs**: Still used by 30-40% of authors
- **Specialized tools**: Dabble, Novlr, yWriter (smaller adoption)

**Organization Tools:**
- **Scrivener corkboard**: Visual scene organization
- **Separate documents**: Character sheets, world-building notes (fragmented!)
- **Spreadsheets**: Plot tracking, series bibles (manual, tedious)

**Pain Point Identified:** Authors currently track characters and world-building in **fragmented separate documents**, creating sync issues and context-switching overhead.
