"Book metadata optimization is crucial - **fine-tuning elements** such as book keywords and selecting correct KDP categories can **significantly enhance visibility** on Amazon search results"

## 8.2 Keywords Strategy

**KDP Keyword Guidelines:** ([Kindlepreneur](https://kindlepreneur.com/7-kindle-keywords/), [Publish Drive](https://publishdrive.com/how-to-choose-keywords-for-amazon-kdp.html))

**Technical Limits:**
- **7 keyword boxes** on KDP
- **50 characters each** box
- Can be single keyword or phrase

**Best Practices:**
1. **Research auto-suggestions**: "Research Amazon's auto-suggestions to find **trending searches**"
2. **Be specific**: "Clear, short, and specific. Being specific ensures your book is found by people **genuinely interested**"
3. **Avoid keyword stuffing**: "Be cautious not to overstuff keywords"
4. **No redundancy**: "Amazon makes it clear you should **avoid reusing same keyword** that shows up elsewhere in metadata (title, contributor, etc.)"

**Strategic Approach:**
- Option A: Target specific phrase you want to rank for
- Option B: Fill box with multiple related keywords

**Tools Available:**
- **Publisher Rocket**: "Uncovers high-performing Amazon keywords to optimize listings" ([Publisher Rocket](https://publisherrocket.com/))
- **PublishDrive AI**: Metadata generator that analyzes your book ([Publish Drive](https://publishdrive.com/how-to-choose-keywords-for-amazon-kdp.html))

## 8.3 Categories Selection

**Category Strategy:** ([Self-Publishing Advice](https://selfpublishingadvice.org/book-metadata-keywords-and-amazon-category-changes/))

**System Overview:**
- Authors select up to **2 categories** initially on KDP
- Can request up to **10 categories** total via KDP support
- **Amazon may override**: "Amazon may remove you from categories you've chosen and add you to any they feel better fit your book. This decision is based primarily on your **keywords**."

**Critical Timing:**
- **"First three months crucial"** for Amazon's algorithm
- "Amazon prioritizes **new releases** over books that have been stagnant"

**Bestseller Strategy:**
- Choose niche categories with less competition
- Aim for #1 in niche category vs. #10,000 in broad category
- "Bestseller" badge increases visibility exponentially
