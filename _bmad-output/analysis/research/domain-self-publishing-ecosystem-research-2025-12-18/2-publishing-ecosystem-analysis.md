**Key Statistics:**

- **"Wide" strategy** (multi-platform) growing but still minority approach

## 2.2 Distribution Strategies

**KDP Select vs. Wide Distribution:**

**KDP Select** (Amazon Exclusive):
- **Pros**: Kindle Unlimited borrows, promotional tools (Countdown Deals, Free Days), higher visibility in Amazon algorithm
- **Cons**: Platform lock-in, risk concentration, lower per-unit revenue from KU borrows
- **Adoption**: 87.5% of authors have books in KU ([Written Word Media](https://www.writtenwordmedia.com/2024-indie-author-survey-results-insights-into-self-publishing-for-authors/))

**Wide Distribution**:
- **Pros**: Revenue diversification, ownership of customer relationships, less algorithm dependence
- **Cons**: More complex management, lower individual platform visibility, requires more marketing
- **Recommended Platforms**: Apple Books, Kobo, Google Play via Draft2Digital aggregator

**Hybrid Approach** (Increasingly Common):
- Main series in KDP Select for visibility
- Standalone titles or completed series "going wide"
- Use Draft2Digital for automated wide distribution
