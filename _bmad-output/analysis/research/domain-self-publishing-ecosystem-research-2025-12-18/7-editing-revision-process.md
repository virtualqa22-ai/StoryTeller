# 7. Editing & Revision Process

## 7.1 Standard Editing Workflow

**Comprehensive Process:** ([Kaitlin Slowik](https://kaitlinslowik.com/guide-to-the-book-editing-process/), [Reedsy Blog](https://blog.reedsy.com/beta-readers/))

1. **Self-Editing (Multiple Passes)**
   - Structural issues, plot holes, pacing
   - Scene-level revisions, character consistency
   - Line editing for prose quality
   - "Take your manuscript through several rounds" before external feedback

2. **Beta Readers**
   - **Definition**: "Readers responding to your story who tell you which parts are working and which confused them" ([Reedsy](https://blog.reedsy.com/beta-readers/))
   - **Value**: "Represent a microcosm of potential audience" ([Medium - Brecht Corbeel](https://medium.com/@brechtcorbeel/what-role-do-editors-and-beta-readers-play-in-the-writing-process-ece0069cfef1))
   - **Feedback type**: Reader perspective, emotional resonance, character development
   - **Limitation**: "Can be helpful at identifying issues but less skilled at **pinpointing solutions**" ([Alyssa Matesic](https://www.alyssamatesic.com/free-writing-resources/beta-readers-and-book-editors))

3. **Professional Editing**
   - **Developmental Editing**: Theme, organization, plot, characters, logical flow ([Kaitlin Slowik](https://kaitlinslowik.com/guide-to-the-book-editing-process/))
   - **Line Editing**: Sentence structure, word choice, flow
   - **Copy Editing**: Grammar, punctuation, consistency
   - **Proofreading**: Final typo and error catch

4. **Final Author Review**
   - Approve all editorial changes
   - One last read-through

## 7.2 Beta Readers vs. Professional Editors

**When to Use Beta Readers:** ([Indie Author Magazine](https://indieauthormagazine.com/developmental-editor-or-beta-readers-navigating-the-book-revision-conundrum/))
- **Early drafts**: Get reader reactions before heavy investment
- **Target audience check**: Ensure genre expectations met
- **Cost-effective**: Free or low-cost feedback
- **Multiple perspectives**: Diverse reader insights

**When to Use Professional Editors:**
- **Solutions needed**: "Professional editor can help you **nail a game plan** for revisions" ([Alyssa Matesic](https://www.alyssamatesic.com/free-writing-resources/beta-readers-and-book-editors))
- **Commercial quality**: Professional polish required
- **Structural problems**: Developmental expertise needed
- **Genre-specific requirements**: Editor with genre experience

**Best Practice:**
- "Neither needs to be mutually exclusive - **many indie authors combine** each service"
- **Typical order**: Beta readers first, then professional editing ([Indie Author Magazine](https://indieauthormagazine.com/developmental-editor-or-beta-readers-navigating-the-book-revision-conundrum/))
