## 6.1 Daily Word Count Goals

**Productivity Research:** ([Productive Indie Fiction Writer](https://productiveindiefictionwriter.com/just-start-lets-revisit-this-idea-2/), [Jennifer Ellis](https://www.jenniferellis.ca/minimum-daily-word-counts), [Word Counter](https://wordcounter.net/blog/2017/12/04/103207_the-daily-word-counts-of-19-famous-writers.html))

**The Answer:** "Whatever daily word count works best for your business, your life, and what time you have to write"

**Famous Author Examples:**

**High-Volume Writers:**
- Michael Crichton: **10,000 words/day**
- Rachel Aaron: Increased from 2,000 to **10,000 words/day** through optimization
- Holly Black: Tries for **1,000 words/day** (admits "not always the reality")

**Moderate Goals:**
- Brandon Sanderson: **2,000 words/day minimum** (or page goal when revising) ([Brandon Sanderson FAQ](https://faq.brandonsanderson.com/knowledge-base/what-is-your-daily-wordcount-time-goal/))
- Graham Greene: **500 words/day** for 20 years consistently
- Jeff Goins: **500 words minimum**, may hit 5,000 on deadlines

**Key Insights:**
- **"Focus on hourly word count rather than daily"** - daily depends on available writing time ([Productive Indie Fiction Writer](https://productiveindiefictionwriter.com/just-start-lets-revisit-this-idea-2/))
- **Environment matters**: Rachel Aaron most productive in coffee shop vs. home (fewer distractions)
- **"Cultivating a writing routine is vital"** - consistency beats intensity ([The Novelry](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/word-counts))
