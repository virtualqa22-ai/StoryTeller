# 9. Series Management Strategies

## 9.1 Series Publishing Fundamentals

**Publishing Philosophy:** ([Writer's Digest](https://www.writersdigest.com/getting-published/querying-about-a-trilogy), [Nathan Bransford](https://nathanbransford.com/blog/2020/03/everything-writers-need-to-know-about-book-series))

**Key Principle:**
- "The key to selling a trilogy is **selling the first book first**"
- "Focus your query letter on **book one** and pitch it as if it weren't in a trilogy"
- Don't mention future books or plots in initial pitch

**Series vs. Connected Books:**
- **True Series**: "One continuous story told over multiple titles" - harder to sell to publishers
- **Connected Books**: "Several related titles that share setting and characters" - easier publisher commitment

## 9.2 Series Publication Timing

**Strategic Approaches:** ([Self-Publishing Advice](https://selfpublishingadvice.org/marketing-whats-the-best-timing-for-self-publishing-a-series/), [Master Writer Mindset](https://writingandwellness.com/2020/08/19/what-you-need-to-know-when-writing-and-publishing-a-trilogy/))

**Option A: Rapid Release (Recommended for Debut)**
- "Write all books before launching"
- "Forces you to come into publishing with **business plan and marketing strategy**"
- "Release much closer together rather than year apart"
- **Benefit**: "Prevents **reader loss** between books"

**Option B: Traditional Pacing**
- Release books 6-12 months apart
- Allows building audience gradually
- Risk: Readers forget plot between releases

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Write 2-3 books before releasing first
- Release 2-3 months apart
- Balance between rapid and traditional

## 9.3 Series Marketing Tactics

**First Book Strategy:** ([BookBub Insights](https://insights.bookbub.com/publishing-a-sequel-book-marketing-tips-you-need-to-know/))

**Permafree Tactic:**
- "Making **first book in series permafree** can be excellent way to attract new readers"
- "Readers are **10 times more likely** to click on free book than discounted book"
- Goal: Hook readers, drive sales of books 2-7

**Read-Through Rates:**
- "**Most significant drop-off** between first and second books"
- "Essential metric for authors of series or trilogies"
- Industry average: 60-70% read-through from book 1 to book 2
- Good read-through: 80%+

**Series Launch Checklist:**
1. Consistent branding across all covers
2. Series name prominently displayed
3. Clear book numbering
4. Back matter in each book promoting next title
5. Series newsletter/reader magnet
6. AMS ads targeting series keywords
