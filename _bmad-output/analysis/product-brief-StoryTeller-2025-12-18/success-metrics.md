# Success Metrics

## User Success Metrics

**Primary Measure: AI Trust & Adoption**

Success means users trust StoryTeller's AI enough to use it for first-draft generation, not just brainstorming.

**Key User Success Indicators:**

1. **Novel Completion Rate**
   - **Metric:** % of users who complete 50,000+ word novel using StoryTeller
   - **Target:** 60%+ completion rate for beta users (vs. industry avg. of 3-5%)
   - **Why it matters:** Proves the tool actually helps authors finish, not just start

2. **AI Consistency Trust**
   - **Metric:** % of users who use AI for full chapter generation (4,000+ words)
   - **Target:** 80%+ of power users (like James) trust AI for chapters by Week 4
   - **Measurement:** Track AI generation length and frequency
   - **Why it matters:** Core differentiator—if users don't trust long-form AI, positioning fails

3. **Export Success**
   - **Metric:** % of users who successfully export publication-ready PDF/EPUB
   - **Target:** 95%+ export success rate on first attempt
   - **Why it matters:** Sarah's success moment—must work flawlessly

4. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
   - **Metric:** Would you recommend StoryTeller to other authors? (0-10 scale)
   - **Target:** NPS >50 (world-class product)
   - **Segmented:** Track separately for Sarah-type vs. James-type users

**User Behavior Indicators:**

- **Sarah's Success:** Completes first novel → Exports professional PDF → Publishes on Amazon → Returns for Book 2
- **James's Success:** Migrates existing project → Generates 3+ chapters with AI → Zero contradiction complaints → Increases publishing velocity

## Business Objectives

**Phase 1: Beta Validation (Months 1-8)**

**Primary Objective:** Prove long-form AI accuracy works at scale with real authors writing real novels

**Success Criteria:**
- 30+ beta authors actively writing novels in StoryTeller
- 10+ completed novels (50,000+ words) using StoryTeller AI
- <5% AI contradiction rate (measured by human review + automated validation)
- 5+ case studies: "I wrote my novel with zero AI contradictions"
- 3+ video testimonials demonstrating AI catching consistency errors

**Why this matters:** Without proof, the entire "long-form accuracy first" positioning collapses. Beta must generate undeniable evidence.
