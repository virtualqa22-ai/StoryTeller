## Out of Scope for V1.0

**Deferred to V1.5-2.0:**

❌ **Advanced Export Features**
- Custom export presets and templates
- Genre-specific formatting templates
- Advanced typography controls

- **Rationale:** Basic export proves value; advanced customization is enhancement

❌ **Advanced Organization Tools**

- Character dashboard with visual relationship maps
- Timeline visualization
- Research folder organization
- **Rationale:** Story Bible provides core tracking; these are productivity enhancements

❌ **Progressive Onboarding & UX Polish**
- Intelligent prompting system
- Context-sensitive tutorials
- Template library (genre templates)
- Guided project setup wizards
- **Rationale:** Beta users are early adopters who tolerate rough edges

❌ **Multi-Model AI Integration**
- Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Deepseek, Yandex
- API key management
- Model selection and fallback
- **Rationale:** Single best model for V1.0, expand after proving accuracy

❌ **Collaboration Features**
- Beta reader workflows
- Feedback management
- Multi-user access
- **Rationale:** V1.0 serves individual authors only

❌ **Publishing Integration**
- Direct upload to Amazon KDP
