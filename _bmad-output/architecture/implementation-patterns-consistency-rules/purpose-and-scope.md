# Purpose and Scope

This section defines mandatory patterns that **all AI agents must follow** when implementing StoryTeller features. These patterns prevent conflicts, ensure consistency, and enable multiple agents to work on the codebase without breaking each other's code.

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:** 20+ areas where different AI agents could make incompatible implementation choices.
