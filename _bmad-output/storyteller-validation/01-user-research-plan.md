## Research Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Validate Persona Accuracy**
   - Do Sarah, James, and Elena personas represent real user segments?
   - What are their actual pain points, behaviors, and needs?
   - What is the size and willingness to pay of each segment?

2. **Validate Pain Points**
   - Is AI consistency/contradiction a real problem users experience?
   - How much time/frustration does manual consistency checking cause?
   - Are there other pain points more severe than assumed?

3. **Validate Story Bible Value Proposition**
   - Do users understand the "Story Bible" concept?
   - Would transparent AI validation build trust?
   - Is this feature worth paying for?

4. **Validate Feature Priorities**
   - Which features matter most: Story Bible, AI generation, Export, Progress tracking?
   - What's "must-have" vs. "nice-to-have"?
   - Are we missing critical features?

5. **Validate Pricing Sensitivity**
   - What's acceptable price point: $50? $99? $149?
   - One-time purchase vs. subscription preference?
   - Willingness to pay for AI features separately?

## Interview Methodology

### Interview Structure (60 minutes)

**Part 1: Current State Discovery (20 minutes)**

**Questions:**
1. Tell me about your novel writing process from start to finish.
2. Walk me through a typical writing session. What tools do you use?
3. What's the hardest part of writing a novel for you?
4. How do you track character details, plot points, world-building rules?
   - Prompts: Spreadsheets? Notes? Memory? Software?
5. Tell me about a time you forgot a story detail. What happened?
6. Have you tried AI writing tools? Which ones?
   - If yes: What was your experience? What did you love/hate?
   - If no: What's stopped you from trying them?
7. How do you ensure consistency across your manuscript?
   - How much time do you spend on this?
   - What tools or methods do you use?

**Part 2: Pain Point Validation (15 minutes)**

**Show examples of AI contradictions:**
- Example 1: Character's eye color changes (blue → brown)
- Example 2: Timeline inconsistency (Tuesday → Thursday)
- Example 3: Profession change (scientist → teacher)

**Questions:**
1. Has this ever happened to you? How often?
2. How did you discover it? How did you fix it?
3. If this happened in your published novel, how would you feel?
4. On a scale of 1-10, how much does this problem affect you?
   - 1 = Never happens, not a concern
   - 10 = Happens constantly, major frustration
5. What would "perfect consistency tracking" look like to you?
6. What would make you trust an AI tool with your story?

**Part 3: Concept Testing (20 minutes)**

**Test 1: Story Bible Mental Model**

Show Figma mockup of Story Bible concept (character cards, location entries, plot points).

**Questions:**
1. In your own words, what do you think this does?
2. Would this solve a problem you currently have?
3. What concerns do you have about using something like this?
4. How is this different from what you do now?
5. On a scale of 1-10, how valuable would this be to you?

**Test 2: Three-Layer Visibility**

Show three levels:
- Layer 1: Simple "✓ No contradictions detected"
- Layer 2: Progress indicators "Checking 15 character details, 8 plot points..."
- Layer 3: Full transparency "Marcus's blue eyes matches Chapter 3, Military background matches Chapter 1..."

**Questions:**
1. Which layer would you look at most often? Why?
2. Would you ever click "View Details" (Layer 3)? When?
3. Does seeing this level of detail make you trust the AI more or less? Why?
4. What information is missing that you'd want to see?

**Test 3: Onboarding Paths**

Show three options:
- Guided: 5-step wizard with explanations
- Quick Start: Minimal setup, start writing immediately
- Demo Project: Pre-populated example to explore

**Questions:**
1. Which would you choose? Why?
2. Have you ever abandoned software during setup? What happened?
3. What would make you complete the setup vs. abandon it?

**Part 4: Pricing & Value (5 minutes)**

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter:**

1. **Too Cheap:** "At what price would you feel this product is so inexpensive that you'd question its quality?"
2. **Bargain:** "At what price would you consider this product a bargain—a great buy for the money?"
3. **Expensive:** "At what price would you say this product is getting expensive, but you'd still consider buying it?"
4. **Too Expensive:** "At what price would this product be so expensive that you wouldn't consider buying it?"

**Additional Questions:**
1. Would you prefer to pay once ($X) or monthly ($Y)? Why?
2. If the base app was $89 (writing + manual Story Bible) and AI features were $99/year extra, would that make sense?
3. What features would you expect in a free version vs. paid?
4. How does this compare to [Scrivener $49 / Sudowrite $100/mo / Atticus $147]?

**Wrap-up:**
1. What's the one feature that would make you switch from your current tools?
2. Is there anything we didn't talk about that's important to you?
3. Would you be interested in trying an early version (beta) when available?

## Hypotheses to Test

### Hypothesis 1: Story Bible is Primary Value Driver
**Test:** "Users will rank Story Bible consistency tracking as #1 or #2 most valuable feature"
**Method:** Ask users to rank features by value: Writing tools, Story Bible, AI generation, Professional export, Progress tracking
**Invalidation Trigger:** If < 60% rank it top 2, it's not primary value driver
**Action if Invalidated:** Reassess positioning and feature priorities

### Hypothesis 2: AI Trust Requires Transparency
**Test:** "Users who see validation proof will trust AI more than those who see simple success message"
**Method:** A/B test in prototype - show half Group A (simple "✓ Success"), half Group B (detailed proof)
**Invalidation Trigger:** If no significant trust difference between groups
**Action if Invalidated:** Simplify UX, remove transparency layers

### Hypothesis 3: Multiple Onboarding Paths Increase Completion
**Test:** "Users will prefer different paths based on learning style, and choice increases satisfaction"
**Method:** Track which path users choose and measure satisfaction
**Invalidation Trigger:** If > 80% choose same path, multiple paths are unnecessary complexity
**Action if Invalidated:** Build single best path, remove options

### Hypothesis 4: Sarah is Largest Market Segment
**Test:** "First-time/aspiring authors outnumber prolific pros 5:1 in willingness to pay"
**Method:** Recruitment difficulty + pricing research + TAM analysis
**Invalidation Trigger:** If James-types show higher willingness to pay or larger available market
**Action if Invalidated:** Shift primary persona to James, redesign for productivity-first

### Hypothesis 5: Users Will Pay $50-100
**Test:** "Target users have willingness to pay $50+ for Story Bible + AI features"
**Method:** Van Westendorp pricing sensitivity analysis
**Invalidation Trigger:** If optimal price point < $30, business model needs revision
**Action if Invalidated:** Pursue freemium model or reduce scope to lower development cost

### Hypothesis 6: Offline-First is Feature, Not Limitation
**Test:** "Users value offline capability and local storage for privacy/independence"
**Method:** Ask about cloud sync importance vs. offline work, privacy concerns
**Invalidation Trigger:** If > 70% demand multi-device sync as must-have
**Action if Invalidated:** Prioritize cloud sync in v1.0, not v1.5

  - Layer 2 (expandable): "Checking 15 character details, 8 plot points..."
  - Layer 3 (expandable): "✓ Marcus's blue eyes - matches Chapter 3, ✓ Military background - matches Chapter 1..."
- Actions: [Regenerate] [Edit] [Accept] [Cancel]

**Prototype 4: Contradiction Resolution**
- Warning state: "⚠️ Story Inconsistency Detected"
- Side-by-side comparison:
  - Left: "Your Story Bible says: Marcus has blue eyes (Chapter 3)"
  - Right: "This generation says: 'Marcus's brown eyes...'"
- Actions: "Which is correct? [Blue - Keep Story Bible] [Brown - Update Story Bible] [I'll Fix It Myself]"

## Analysis Plan

### Qualitative Analysis

**Persona Validation:**
- Synthesize common behaviors, pain points, tools across interviews
- Refine persona profiles with actual quotes and patterns
- Identify unexpected persona segments (if any)
- Assign market size estimates based on recruitment difficulty

**Feature Value Matrix:**
- Aggregate feature rankings across all participants
- Identify must-haves vs. nice-to-haves by persona
- Map features to pain points solved
- Highlight gaps (features users want that we don't have)

**Mental Model Assessment:**
- Document how users described Story Bible concept in their own words
- Identify confusion points or misunderstandings
- Assess whether "Story Bible" terminology resonates
- Consider alternative names if needed

**Trust Building Analysis:**
- Compare trust ratings between simple success (Layer 1) vs. detailed proof (Layer 3)
- Identify which validation details matter most to users
- Assess whether transparency feels helpful or overwhelming
- Document specific trust-building moments or concerns

### Quantitative Analysis

**Van Westendorp Pricing:**
- Plot four lines (Too Cheap, Bargain, Expensive, Too Expensive) on graph
- Find intersection of "Not Cheap" (Too Cheap + Bargain) and "Not Expensive" (Expensive + Too Expensive)
- Identify acceptable price range
- Find optimal price point (intersection of Bargain and Expensive)
- Analyze by persona (Sarah vs. James vs. Elena)

**Feature Priority Scoring:**
- Calculate average rank for each feature
- Weight by persona market size (if Sarah is 70% of market, weight her scores 0.7x)
- Identify features ranked #1-2 by > 60% of participants (must-haves)
- Identify features ranked #4-5 by > 60% (deprioritize or cut)

**Onboarding Path Preference:**
- Count selections: Guided / Quick Start / Demo
- Cross-tabulate by persona
- Measure completion rate in prototype
- Assess whether offering choice increases or decreases satisfaction
