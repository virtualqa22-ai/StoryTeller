# Analysis Plan

## Qualitative Analysis

**Persona Validation:**
- Synthesize common behaviors, pain points, tools across interviews
- Refine persona profiles with actual quotes and patterns
- Identify unexpected persona segments (if any)
- Assign market size estimates based on recruitment difficulty

**Feature Value Matrix:**
- Aggregate feature rankings across all participants
- Identify must-haves vs. nice-to-haves by persona
- Map features to pain points solved
- Highlight gaps (features users want that we don't have)

**Mental Model Assessment:**
- Document how users described Story Bible concept in their own words
- Identify confusion points or misunderstandings
- Assess whether "Story Bible" terminology resonates
- Consider alternative names if needed

**Trust Building Analysis:**
- Compare trust ratings between simple success (Layer 1) vs. detailed proof (Layer 3)
- Identify which validation details matter most to users
- Assess whether transparency feels helpful or overwhelming
- Document specific trust-building moments or concerns

## Quantitative Analysis

**Van Westendorp Pricing:**
- Plot four lines (Too Cheap, Bargain, Expensive, Too Expensive) on graph
- Find intersection of "Not Cheap" (Too Cheap + Bargain) and "Not Expensive" (Expensive + Too Expensive)
- Identify acceptable price range
- Find optimal price point (intersection of Bargain and Expensive)
- Analyze by persona (Sarah vs. James vs. Elena)

**Feature Priority Scoring:**
- Calculate average rank for each feature
- Weight by persona market size (if Sarah is 70% of market, weight her scores 0.7x)
- Identify features ranked #1-2 by > 60% of participants (must-haves)
- Identify features ranked #4-5 by > 60% (deprioritize or cut)
