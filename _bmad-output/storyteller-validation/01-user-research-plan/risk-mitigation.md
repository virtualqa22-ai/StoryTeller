# Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low Recruitment Response**
- **Mitigation:** Post in multiple channels simultaneously
- **Mitigation:** Increase incentive to $100 if needed
- **Mitigation:** Extend recruitment timeline by 1 week
- **Fallback:** Accept 15 participants (5/5/5) instead of 20

**Risk 2: Participants Don't Match Personas**
- **Mitigation:** Careful screening with 5+ qualifying questions
- **Mitigation:** Over-recruit (schedule 25 to account for no-shows and mismatches)
- **Mitigation:** Be flexible on exact demographics if behavior matches

**Risk 3: Prototype Confusion Skews Results**
- **Mitigation:** Test prototypes with 2 pilot users before main interviews
- **Mitigation:** Iterate prototypes based on pilot feedback
- **Mitigation:** Focus on concept understanding, not prototype polish

**Risk 4: Findings Contradict Core Assumptions**
- **Acceptance:** This is WHY we're doing research
- **Action:** Be prepared to pivot on persona priority, features, or pricing
- **Action:** Don't ignore data that conflicts with hopes
- **Mindset:** "Strong opinions, weakly held"
