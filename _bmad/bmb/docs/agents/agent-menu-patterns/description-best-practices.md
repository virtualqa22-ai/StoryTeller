# Description Best Practices

## Good Descriptions

```yaml
# Clear action + object
- description: 'Create Product Requirements Document'

# Specific outcome
- description: 'Analyze security vulnerabilities'

# User benefit
- description: 'Optimize code for performance'

# Context when needed
- description: 'Start here - initialize workflow path'
```

## Poor Descriptions

```yaml
# Too vague
- description: 'Process'

# Technical jargon
- description: 'Execute WF123'

# Missing context
- description: 'Run'

# Redundant with trigger
- description: 'Create PRD' # trigger: create-prd (too similar)
```
