# Prevention Tips

**Avoid common issues before they happen:**

1. ✅ **Always run document-project for brownfield** - Saves hours of context issues later
2. ✅ **Use fresh chats for complex workflows** - Prevents hallucinations and context overflow
3. ✅ **Verify files exist before running workflows** - Check PRD, epics, stories are present
4. ✅ **Read agent menu before requesting workflows** - Confirm agent has the workflow
5. ✅ **Start with smaller level if unsure** - Easy to upgrade (Level 1 → 2), hard to downgrade
6. ✅ **Keep status files updated** - Manual updates when needed, don't let them drift
7. ✅ **Run retrospectives after epics** - Catch issues early, improve next epic
8. ✅ **Follow phase sequence** - Don't skip required phases (Phase 2 before 3, 3 before 4)
