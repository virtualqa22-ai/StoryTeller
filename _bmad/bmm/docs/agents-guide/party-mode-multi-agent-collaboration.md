# Party Mode: Multi-Agent Collaboration

Get all your installed agents in one conversation for multi-perspective discussions, retrospectives, and collaborative decision-making.

**Quick Start:**

```bash
/bmad:core:workflows:party-mode
# OR from any agent: *party-mode
```

**What happens:** BMad Master orchestrates 2-3 relevant agents per message. They discuss, debate, and collaborate in real-time.

**Best for:** Strategic decisions, creative brainstorming, post-mortems, sprint retrospectives, complex problem-solving.

**Current BMM uses:** Powers `epic-retrospective` workflow, sprint planning discussions.

**Future:** Advanced elicitation workflows will officially leverage party mode.
