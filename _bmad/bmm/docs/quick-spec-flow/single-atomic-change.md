## What You Get

1. **tech-spec.md** - Comprehensive technical specification with:

   - Brownfield code patterns (if applicable)
   - Existing test patterns to follow
   - Specific file paths to modify
   - Complete implementation guidance

2. **story-[slug].md** - Single user story ready for development

## Quick Spec Flow Commands

```bash
# Start Quick Spec Flow (no workflow-init needed!)
# Load PM agent and run tech-spec

# When complete, implement directly:
# Load DEV agent and run dev-story
```
