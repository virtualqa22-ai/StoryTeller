# What is Quick Spec Flow?

Quick Spec Flow is a **streamlined alternative** to the full BMad Method for Quick Flow track projects. Instead of going through Product Brief → PRD → Architecture, you go **straight to a context-aware technical specification** and start coding.

## When to Use Quick Spec Flow

✅ **Use Quick Flow track when:**

- Single bug fix or small enhancement
- Small feature with clear scope (typically 1-15 stories)
- Rapid prototyping or experimentation
- Adding to existing brownfield codebase
- You know exactly what you want to build

❌ **Use BMad Method or Enterprise tracks when:**

- Building new products or major features
- Need stakeholder alignment
- Complex multi-team coordination
- Requires extensive planning and architecture

💡 **Not sure?** Run `workflow-init` to get a recommendation based on your project's needs!
