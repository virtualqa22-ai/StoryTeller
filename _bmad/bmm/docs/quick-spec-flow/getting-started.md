# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- BMad Method installed (`npx bmad-method install`)
- Project directory with code (or empty for greenfield)

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# For a quick bug fix or small change:
# 1. Load PM agent
# 2. Say: "I want to [describe your change]"
# 3. PM will ask if you want to run tech-spec
# 4. Answer questions about your change
# 5. Get tech-spec + story
# 6. Load DEV agent and implement!

# For a small feature with multiple stories:
# Same as above, but get epic + 2-3 stories
# Optionally use SM sprint-planning to organize
```

## No workflow-init Required!

Quick Spec Flow is **fully standalone**:

- Detects if it's a single change or multi-story feature
- Asks for greenfield vs brownfield
- Works without status file tracking
- Perfect for rapid prototyping
