# Tips and Best Practices

## 1. **Be Specific in Discovery**

When describing your change, provide specifics:

- ✅ "Fix email validation in UserService to allow plus-addressing"
- ❌ "Fix validation bug"

## 2. **Trust the Convention Detection**

If it detects your patterns correctly, say yes! It's faster than establishing new conventions.

## 3. **Use WebSearch Recommendations for Greenfield**

Starter templates save hours of setup time. Let Quick Spec Flow find the best ones.

## 4. **Review the Auto-Validation**

When validation runs, read the scores. They tell you if your spec is production-ready.

## 5. **Keep Single Changes Truly Atomic**

If your "single change" needs 3+ files, it might be a multi-story feature. Let the workflow guide you.

## 6. **Validate Story Sequence for Multi-Story Features**

When you get multiple stories, check the dependency validation output. Proper sequence matters!
