# When to Graduate from Quick Flow to BMad Method

Start with Quick Flow, but switch to BMad Method when:

- ❌ Project grows beyond initial scope
- ❌ Multiple teams need coordination
- ❌ Stakeholders need formal documentation
- ❌ Product vision is unclear
- ❌ Architectural decisions need deep analysis
- ❌ Compliance/regulatory requirements exist

💡 **Tip:** You can always run `workflow-init` later to transition from Quick Flow to BMad Method!
