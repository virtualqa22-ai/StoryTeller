# Key Differences from Legacy System

## Old System (Levels 0-4)

- Arbitrary story count thresholds
- Level 2 vs Level 3 based on story count
- Confusing overlap zones (5-10 stories, 12-40 stories)
- Tech-spec and PRD shown as conflicting options

## New System (3 Tracks)

- Methodology-based distinction (not story counts)
- Story counts as guidance, not definitions
- Clear track purposes:
  - Quick Flow = Implementation-focused
  - BMad Method = Product + system design
  - Enterprise = Extended with security/ops
- Mutually exclusive paths chosen upfront
- Educational decision-making
