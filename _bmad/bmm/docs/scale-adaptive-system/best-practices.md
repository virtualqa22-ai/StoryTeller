# Best Practices

## 1. Document-Project First for Brownfield

Always run `document-project` before starting brownfield planning. AI agents need existing codebase context.

## 2. Trust the Recommendation

If `workflow-init` suggests BMad Method, there's probably complexity you haven't considered. Review carefully before overriding.

## 3. Start Smaller if Uncertain

Uncertain between Quick Flow and Method? Start with Quick Flow. You can create PRD later if needed.

## 4. Don't Skip Implementation Readiness Check

For BMad Method and Enterprise, implementation readiness checks prevent costly mistakes. Invest the time.

## 5. Architecture is Optional but Recommended for Brownfield

Brownfield BMad Method makes architecture optional, but it's highly recommended. It distills complex codebase into focused solution design.

## 6. Discovery Phase Based on Need

Brainstorming and research are offered regardless of track. Use them when you need to think through the problem space.

## 7. Product Brief for Greenfield Method

Product Brief is only offered for greenfield BMad Method and Enterprise. It's optional but helps with strategic thinking.
