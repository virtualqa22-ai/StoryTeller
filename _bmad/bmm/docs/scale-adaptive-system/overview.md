# Overview

The **Scale Adaptive System** intelligently routes projects to the right planning methodology based on complexity, not arbitrary story counts.

## The Problem

Traditional methodologies apply the same process to every project:

- Bug fix requires full design docs
- Enterprise system built with minimal planning
- One-size-fits-none approach

## The Solution

BMad Method adapts to three distinct planning tracks:

- **Quick Flow**: Tech-spec only, implement immediately
- **BMad Method**: PRD + Architecture, structured approach
- **Enterprise Method**: Full planning with security/devops/test

**Result**: Right planning depth for every project.
