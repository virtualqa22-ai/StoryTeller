# Migration from Old System

If you have existing projects using the old level system:

- **Level 0-1** → Quick Flow
- **Level 2-3** → BMad Method
- **Level 4** → Enterprise Method

Run `workflow-init` on existing projects to migrate to new tracking system. It detects existing planning artifacts and creates appropriate workflow tracking.
