# Prevention Tips

**Avoid issues before they happen:**

1. ✅ **Always run document-project for brownfield** - Saves context issues later
2. ✅ **Use fresh chats for complex workflows** - Prevents hallucinations
3. ✅ **Verify files exist before workflows** - Check PRD, epics, stories present
4. ✅ **Read agent menu first** - Confirm agent has the workflow
5. ✅ **Start with simpler track if unsure** - Easy to upgrade (Quick Flow → BMad Method)
6. ✅ **Keep status files updated** - Manual updates when needed
7. ✅ **Run retrospectives after epics** - Catch issues early
8. ✅ **Follow phase sequence** - Don't skip required phases
