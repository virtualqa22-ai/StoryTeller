# What is Brownfield Development?

Brownfield projects involve working within existing codebases rather than starting fresh:

- **Bug fixes** - Single file changes
- **Small features** - Adding to existing modules
- **Feature sets** - Multiple related features
- **Major integrations** - Complex architectural additions
- **System expansions** - Enterprise-scale enhancements

**Key Difference from Greenfield:** You must understand and respect existing patterns, architecture, and constraints.

**Core Principle:** AI agents need comprehensive documentation to understand existing code before they can effectively plan or implement changes.
