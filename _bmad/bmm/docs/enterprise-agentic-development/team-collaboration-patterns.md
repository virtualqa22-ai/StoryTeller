# Team Collaboration Patterns

## Old Pattern: Story Parallelism

**Traditional Agile:**

```
Epic: User Dashboard (8 weeks)
├─ Story 1: Backend API (Dev A, Sprint 1-2)
├─ Story 2: Frontend Layout (Dev B, Sprint 1-2)
├─ Story 3: Data Viz (Dev C, Sprint 2-3)
└─ Story 4: Integration Testing (Team, Sprint 3-4)

Challenge: Coordination overhead, merge conflicts, integration issues
```

## New Pattern: Epic Ownership

**Agentic Development:**

```
Project: Analytics Platform (2-3 weeks)

Developer A:
└─ Epic 1: User Dashboard (3 days, 12 stories sequentially with AI)

Developer B:
└─ Epic 2: Admin Panel (4 days, 15 stories sequentially with AI)

Developer C:
└─ Epic 3: Reporting Engine (5 days, 18 stories sequentially with AI)

Benefit: Minimal coordination, epic-level ownership, clear boundaries
```
