# Summary

## Key Transformation

**Work Unit Changed:**

- **Old:** Story = unit of work assignment
- **New:** Epic = unit of work assignment

**Why:** AI agents collapse story duration (days → hours), making epic ownership practical.

## Velocity Impact

- **Traditional:** Months for epic delivery, heavy coordination
- **Agentic:** Days for epic delivery, minimal coordination
- **Result:** 10-50× productivity gains

## PM/UX Evolution

**BMad Method enables:**

- PMs to write AI-executable PRDs
- UX designers to validate through working prototypes
- Technical fluency without CS degrees
- Orchestration of cloud AI agent teams
- Career evolution to Full-Stack Product Lead

## Enterprise Adoption

**Git submodules:** Best practice for BMM management across teams
**Team flexibility:** Mix of tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) with shared BMM foundation
**Scalable patterns:** Epic-based, layer-based, feature-based distribution strategies

## The Future (2026)

PMs write BMad PRDs → Stories auto-fed to cloud AI agents → Parallel implementation → Human review of PRs → Continuous deployment

**The future isn't AI replacing PMs—it's AI-augmented PMs becoming 10× more powerful.**
