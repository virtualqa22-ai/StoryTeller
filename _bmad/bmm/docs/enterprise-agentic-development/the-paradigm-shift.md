# The Paradigm Shift

## Traditional Agile: Team-Based Story Parallelism

- **Epic duration:** 4-12 weeks across multiple sprints
- **Story duration:** 2-5 days per developer
- **Team size:** 5-9 developers working on same epic
- **Parallelization:** Multiple devs on stories within single epic
- **Coordination:** Constant - daily standups, merge conflicts, integration overhead

**Example:** Payment Processing Epic

- Sprint 1-2: Backend API (Dev A)
- Sprint 1-2: Frontend UI (Dev B)
- Sprint 2-3: Testing (Dev C)
- **Result:** 6-8 weeks, 3 developers, high coordination

## Agentic Development: Individual Epic Ownership

- **Epic duration:** Hours to days (not weeks)
- **Story duration:** 30 min to 4 hours with AI agent
- **Team size:** 1 developer + AI agents completes full epics
- **Parallelization:** Developers work on separate epics
- **Coordination:** Minimal - epic boundaries, async updates

**Same Example:** Payment Processing Epic

- Day 1 AM: Backend API stories (1 dev + agent, 3-4 stories)
- Day 1 PM: Frontend UI stories (same dev + agent, 2-3 stories)
- Day 2: Testing & deployment (same dev + agent, 2 stories)
- **Result:** 1-2 days, 1 developer, minimal coordination

## The Core Difference

**What changed:** AI agents collapse story duration from days to hours, making **epic-level ownership** practical.

**Impact:** Single developer with BMad Method can deliver in 1 day what previously required full team and multiple sprints.
