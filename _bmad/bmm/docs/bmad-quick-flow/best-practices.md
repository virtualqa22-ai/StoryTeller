   - Do you have clear requirements?
   - Is the team comfortable with rapid development?

2. **Prepare Context**
   - Have project documentation ready
   - Know your codebase patterns
   - Identify affected components upfront

3. **Set Clear Boundaries**
   - Define in-scope and out-of-scope items
   - Establish acceptance criteria
   - Identify dependencies

## During Development

1. **Maintain Velocity**
