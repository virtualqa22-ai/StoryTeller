# Overview

Phase 3 (Solutioning) workflows translate **what** to build (from Planning) into **how** to build it (technical design). This phase prevents agent conflicts in multi-epic projects by documenting architectural decisions before implementation begins.

**Key principle:** Make technical decisions explicit and documented so all agents implement consistently. Prevent one agent choosing REST while another chooses GraphQL.

**Required for:** BMad Method (complex projects), Enterprise Method

**Optional for:** BMad Method (simple projects), Quick Flow (skip entirely)
