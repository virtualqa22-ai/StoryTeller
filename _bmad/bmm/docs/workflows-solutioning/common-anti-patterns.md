# Common Anti-Patterns

## ❌ Skipping Architecture for Complex Projects

"Architecture slows us down, let's just start coding."
**Result:** Agent conflicts, inconsistent design, massive rework

## ❌ Over-Engineering Simple Projects

"Let me design this simple feature like a distributed system."
**Result:** Wasted time, over-engineering, analysis paralysis

## ❌ Template-Driven Architecture

"Fill out every section of this architecture template."
**Result:** Documentation theater, no real decisions made

## ❌ Skipping Gate Check

"PRD and architecture look good enough, let's start."
**Result:** Gaps discovered mid-sprint, wasted implementation time

## ✅ Correct Approach

- Use architecture for BMad Method and Enterprise (both required)
- Focus on decisions, not documentation volume
- Enterprise: Add optional extended workflows (test/security/devops) after architecture
- Always run gate check before implementation
