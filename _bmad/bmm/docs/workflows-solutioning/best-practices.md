# Best Practices

## 1. Make Decisions Explicit

Don't leave technology choices implicit. Document decisions with rationale in ADRs so agents understand context.

## 2. Focus on Agent Conflicts

Architecture's primary job is preventing conflicting implementations. Focus on cross-cutting concerns.

## 3. Use ADRs for Key Decisions

Every significant technology choice should have an ADR explaining "why", not just "what".

## 4. Keep It Practical

Don't over-architect simple projects. BMad Simple projects need simple architecture.

## 5. Run Gate Check Before Implementation

Catching alignment issues in solutioning is 10× faster than discovering them mid-implementation.

## 6. Iterate Architecture

Architecture documents are living. Update them as you learn during implementation.
