# Quick Reference

| Workflow                     | Agent       | Track                    | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **create-ux-design**         | UX Designer | BMad Method, Enterprise  | Optional UX design (after PRD, before arch)  |
| **architecture**             | Architect   | BMad Method, Enterprise  | Technical architecture and design decisions  |
| **create-epics-and-stories** | PM          | BMad Method, Enterprise  | Break FRs/NFRs into epics after architecture |
| **implementation-readiness** | Architect   | BMad Complex, Enterprise | Validate planning/solutioning completeness   |

**When to Skip Solutioning:**

- **Quick Flow:** Simple changes don't need architecture → Skip to Phase 4

**When Solutioning is Required:**

- **BMad Method:** Multi-epic projects need architecture to prevent conflicts
- **Enterprise:** Same as BMad Method, plus optional extended workflows (test architecture, security architecture, devops strategy) added AFTER architecture but BEFORE gate check
