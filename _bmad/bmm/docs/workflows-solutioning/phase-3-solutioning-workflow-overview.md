Phase 3 Solutioning has different paths based on the planning track selected:

## Quick Flow Path

- Action: Skip Phase 3 entirely
- Next: Phase 4 (Implementation)

## BMad Method & Enterprise Path

- From Planning: PRD with FRs/NFRs complete
- Optional: create-ux-design (if UX is critical)
- Required: architecture - System design with ADRs
- Required: create-epics-and-stories - Break requirements into implementable stories
- Required: implementation-readiness - Gate check validation
- Enterprise additions: Optional security-architecture and devops-strategy (future workflows)
