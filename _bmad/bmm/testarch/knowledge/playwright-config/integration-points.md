# Integration Points

- **Used in workflows**: `*framework` (config setup), `*ci` (parallelization, artifact upload)
- **Related fragments**:
  - `fixture-architecture.md` - Fixture-based timeout overrides
  - `ci-burn-in.md` - CI pipeline artifact upload
  - `test-quality.md` - Timeout standards (no hard waits)
  - `data-factories.md` - Per-test isolation (no shared global state)
