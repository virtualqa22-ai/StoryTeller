# Integration Points

- **Used in workflows**: `*automate` (auto-healing after test generation), `*atdd` (optional healing for acceptance tests)
- **Related fragments**: `selector-resilience.md` (selector debugging), `timing-debugging.md` (race condition fixes), `network-first.md` (interception patterns), `data-factories.md` (dynamic data handling)
- **Tools**: Error message parsing, AST analysis for code patterns, Playwright MCP (optional), pattern matching
