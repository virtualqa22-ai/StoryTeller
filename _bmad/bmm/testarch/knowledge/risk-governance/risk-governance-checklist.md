# Risk Governance Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] **Risk scoring complete**: All identified risks scored (Probability × Impact)
- [ ] **Ownership assigned**: Every risk >4 has owner, mitigation plan, deadline
- [ ] **Coverage validated**: Every acceptance criterion maps to at least one test
- [ ] **Gate decision documented**: PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED with rationale
- [ ] **Waivers approved**: All waivers have approver, reason, expiry date
- [ ] **Audit trail captured**: Risk history log available for compliance review
- [ ] **Traceability matrix**: Requirements-to-tests mapping up to date
- [ ] **Critical risks resolved**: No score=9 risks in OPEN status
