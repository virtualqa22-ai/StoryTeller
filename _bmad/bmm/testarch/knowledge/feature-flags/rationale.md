Poorly managed feature flags become technical debt: untested variations ship broken code, forgotten flags clutter the codebase, and shared environments become unstable from leftover targeting rules. Structured governance ensures flags are testable, traceable, temporary, and safe. Testing both states prevents surprises when flags flip in production.
