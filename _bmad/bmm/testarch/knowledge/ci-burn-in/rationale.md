# Rationale

CI is the quality gate for production. A poorly configured pipeline either wastes developer time (slow feedback, false positives) or ships broken code (false negatives, insufficient coverage). Burn-in testing ensures reliability by stress-testing changed code, while parallel execution and intelligent test selection optimize speed without sacrificing thoroughness.
