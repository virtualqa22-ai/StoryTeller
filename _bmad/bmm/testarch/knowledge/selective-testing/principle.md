# Principle

Run only the tests you need, when you need them. Use tags/grep to slice suites by risk priority (not directory structure), filter by spec patterns or git diff to focus on impacted areas, and combine priority metadata (P0-P3) with change detection to optimize pre-commit vs. CI execution. Document the selection strategy clearly so teams understand when full regression is mandatory.
