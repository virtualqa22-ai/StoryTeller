# Integration Points

- **Used in workflows**: `*test-design` (initial risk assessment), `*trace` (gate decision Phase 2), `*nfr-assess` (security/performance risks)
- **Related fragments**: `risk-governance.md` (risk scoring matrix, gate decision engine), `test-priorities-matrix.md` (P0-P3 mapping), `nfr-criteria.md` (impact assessment for NFRs)
- **Tools**: TypeScript for type safety, markdown for reports, version control for audit trail
