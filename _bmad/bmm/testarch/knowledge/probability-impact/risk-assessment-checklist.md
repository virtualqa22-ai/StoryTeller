# Risk Assessment Checklist

Before deploying risk matrix:

- [ ] **Probability scale defined**: 1 (unlikely), 2 (possible), 3 (likely) with clear examples
- [ ] **Impact scale defined**: 1 (minor), 2 (degraded), 3 (critical) with concrete criteria
- [ ] **Threshold rules documented**: Score → Action mapping (1-3 = DOCUMENT, 4-5 = MONITOR, 6-8 = MITIGATE, 9 = BLOCK)
- [ ] **Gate integration**: Risk scores drive gate decisions (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)
- [ ] **Re-assessment process**: Risks re-evaluated as project evolves (requirements change, mitigations applied)
- [ ] **Audit trail**: Historical tracking for risk changes (who, when, why)
- [ ] **Mitigation tracking**: Link mitigations to probability reduction (quantify impact)
- [ ] **Reporting**: Risk matrix visualization, trend reports, gate summaries
