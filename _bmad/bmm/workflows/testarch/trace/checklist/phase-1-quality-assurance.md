# Phase 1 Quality Assurance

## Accuracy Checks

- [ ] All acceptance criteria accounted for (none skipped)
- [ ] Test IDs correctly formatted (e.g., 1.3-E2E-001)
- [ ] File paths are correct and accessible
- [ ] Coverage percentages calculated correctly
- [ ] No false positives (tests incorrectly mapped to criteria)
- [ ] No false negatives (existing tests missed in mapping)

## Completeness Checks

- [ ] All test levels considered (E2E, API, Component, Unit)
- [ ] All priorities considered (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- [ ] All coverage statuses used appropriately (FULL, PARTIAL, NONE, UNIT-ONLY, INTEGRATION-ONLY)
- [ ] All gaps have recommendations
- [ ] All quality issues have severity and remediation guidance

## Actionability Checks

- [ ] Recommendations are specific (not generic)
- [ ] Test IDs suggested for new tests
- [ ] Given-When-Then provided for recommended tests
- [ ] Impact explained for each gap
- [ ] Priorities clear (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
