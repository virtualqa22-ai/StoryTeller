- [ ] Coverage gaps identified:
  - [ ] Criteria with NONE status

  - [ ] **HIGH** - P1 criteria without FULL coverage (PR blocker)
  - [ ] **MEDIUM** - P2 criteria without FULL coverage (nightly gap)
  - [ ] **LOW** - P3 criteria without FULL coverage (acceptable)
- [ ] Specific test recommendations provided for each gap:
  - [ ] Suggested test level (E2E, API, Component, Unit)
  - [ ] Test description (Given-When-Then)
  - [ ] Recommended test ID (e.g., 1.3-E2E-004)
