- [ ] Waivers have business justification and approver (if WAIVED)
- [ ] Residual risks are documented (if CONCERNS or WAIVED)

## Evidence-Based

- [ ] Decision is based on actual test results (not guesses)
- [ ] All claims are supported by evidence
- [ ] No assumptions without documentation
- [ ] Evidence sources are cited (CI run IDs, report URLs)

## Transparency

- [ ] Decision rationale is transparent and auditable
- [ ] Criteria evaluation is documented step-by-step
- [ ] Any deviations from standard process are explained
- [ ] Waiver justifications are clear (if applicable)

## Consistency

- [ ] Decision aligns with risk-governance knowledge fragment
- [ ] Priority framework (P0/P1/P2/P3) applied consistently
- [ ] Terminology consistent with test-quality knowledge fragment
