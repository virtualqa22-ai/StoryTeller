# Non-Prescriptive Approach

**Minimal Examples:** This workflow provides principles and patterns, not rigid templates. Teams should adapt NFR categories, thresholds, and assessment criteria to their needs.

**Key Patterns to Follow:**

- Use evidence-based validation (no guessing or inference)
- Apply deterministic rules (consistent PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL classification)
- Never guess thresholds (mark as CONCERNS if unknown)
- Provide actionable recommendations (specific steps, not generic advice)
- Generate gate-ready artifacts (YAML snippets for CI/CD)

**Extend as Needed:**

- Add custom NFR categories (accessibility, internationalization, compliance)
- Integrate with external tools (New Relic, Datadog, SonarQube, JIRA)
- Add custom thresholds and rules
- Link to external assessment systems
