# Overview

This workflow performs a comprehensive assessment of non-functional requirements (NFRs) to validate that the implementation meets performance, security, reliability, and maintainability standards before release. It uses evidence-based validation with deterministic PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL rules and provides actionable recommendations for remediation.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Assess multiple NFR categories (performance, security, reliability, maintainability, custom)
- Validate NFRs against defined thresholds from tech specs, PRD, or defaults
- Classify status deterministically (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL) based on evidence
- Never guess thresholds - mark as CONCERNS if unknown
- Generate gate-ready YAML snippets for CI/CD integration
- Provide quick wins and recommended actions for remediation
- Create evidence checklists for gaps
