# Overview

Generates failing acceptance tests BEFORE implementation following TDD's red-green-refactor cycle. This workflow creates comprehensive test coverage at appropriate levels (E2E, API, Component) with supporting infrastructure (fixtures, factories, mocks) and provides an implementation checklist to guide development.

**Core Principle**: Tests fail first (red phase), then guide development to green, then enable confident refactoring.
