# Prerequisites

Before starting this workflow, verify:

- [ ] Framework scaffolding configured (playwright.config.ts or cypress.config.ts exists)
- [ ] Test directory structure exists (tests/ folder with subdirectories)
- [ ] Package.json has test framework dependencies installed

**Halt only if:** Framework scaffolding is completely missing (run `framework` workflow first)

**Note:** BMad artifacts (story, tech-spec, PRD) are OPTIONAL - workflow can run without them
