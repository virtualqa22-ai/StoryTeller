# Overview

Expands test automation coverage by generating comprehensive test suites at appropriate levels (E2E, API, Component, Unit) with supporting infrastructure. This workflow operates in **dual mode**:

1. **BMad-Integrated Mode**: Works WITH BMad artifacts (story, tech-spec, PRD, test-design) to expand coverage after story implementation
2. **Standalone Mode**: Works WITHOUT BMad artifacts - analyzes existing codebase and generates tests independently

**Core Principle**: Generate prioritized, deterministic tests that avoid duplicate coverage and follow testing best practices.
