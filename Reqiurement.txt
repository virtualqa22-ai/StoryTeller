## **User Journey**

- Home page with 2 buttons: Create new & Open existing
- First ask user for AI API key. It can be any OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Deepseek, Yandex or any.
If model is not reached or its limit is over, user can have an option to change key or add key for another model.
- Now, ask user for New project or existing project.
- If user select new project then, start the project setup wizard.
- If user select existing project, show him list of projects to choose from and then load it.
- For the new project setup,
- Ask user for Genre & Subgenre (Multiselect), then Target Audience & Tone, then, Point of View & Style Reference, then Chapter Count & Word Count, then Story Framework, and then High-Level Plot Premise. Provide pre-defined dropdowns wherever possible.
- Based on these details, start generating:

- Show and ask user inputs whenever required. Save all these details separately and based on these we need to create a whole novel. Ask for confirmations on each step before moving forward.
- Based on all of these details, user enters to main workspace of building actual novel, chapter-by-chapter. Every chapter must show word count.
- Table of content needs to auto generated and maintained.
